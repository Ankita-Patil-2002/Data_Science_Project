**Project Title:** ðŸ§  *Patient's Condition Classification Using Drug Reviews*

This project demonstrates how to classify a patientâ€™s medical conditionâ€”such as **Depression**, **High Blood Pressure**, or **Type 2 Diabetes**â€”based on their **drug review text**. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models, this project predicts the most likely condition from patient feedback.

#### âœ… Key Features:

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removed null values, stopwords, punctuations, and performed **lemmatization** to prepare the review text.
* **Text Vectorization**: Applied **TF-IDF** to transform unstructured text into numerical features.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Used **spaCy** to extract relevant named entities like drug names, symptoms, or dosage mentions.
* **Machine Learning Models**:

  * Trained using **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM**
  * Achieved up to **95% accuracy** in classifying the condition.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.
* **Visualizations**:

  * **Word Cloud** to highlight frequent terms.
  * Charts for model performance and entity distribution.
